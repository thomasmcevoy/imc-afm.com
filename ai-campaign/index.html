    <h1>Although AFM President Gagliardi</h1>

    <p>has announced an agreement with the AMPTP which “established critical guardrails against the misuse of AI”, we
      remain deeply concerned.</p>

    <p>Few if any rank and file members have been permitted to see the actual contract terms, and of these some if not
      all have had to sign "non-disclosure agreements". The Union has refused our requests to share a timetable, and
      appears ready to keep the contract terms secret until the agreement is mailed out for a ratification vote. Such
      secrecy deprives members of the opportunity to study and discuss contract language that will impact the future of
      all recording members.</p>

    <p>You can show your support for a democratic AFM by joining us in co-signing this <a
        href="../assets/AN OPEN LTTER TO THE AFM.pdf">Open Letter to the AFM</a>.</p>
