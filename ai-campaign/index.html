    <h1>In December 2023,</h1>

    <p>responding to rank and file concerns over a lack of strike preparation, ambiguous statements by
      AFM officials,<sup>*</sup> and a general sense that the Union was not planning to defend its recording musician
      members from the “existential threat” of unregulated Generative A.I. in the upcoming American Motion Picture and
      Television Producers (AMPTP) negotiations, IMC posted an <a href="">Action Network pledge</a> which “serve[d]
      notice that we will vote against ratification of any contract obligating AFM members to dig our own graves by
      participating—without a right to consent, compensation, or credit—in the training of our permanent Generative AI
      replacements”.</p>

    <p>Although the Union announced an agreement in February 2024, its terms remained shrouded in an extraordinary
      degree of NDA enforced secrecy, prompting the IMC to protest, calling for an extension of the Ratification vote
      period, and other steps needed to ensure an informed and democratic process (See the 3/21 “Open Letter to
      President Gagliardi... [et al]” below).</p>

    <p>As the April 1st ratification deadline drew near without any response from the Union, the IMC sent a second
      “Open Letter” [see Open Letter 2 below] demanding an end to the secrecy, cancellation of the NDAs, and extension
      on the ratification period to enable open discussion.</p>

    <img class="img-fluid py-2" src="../assets/2nd-open-letter.png">

    <p>On Friday March 29th, a meeting open to all Pledge signers voted to urge bargaining unit members to vote against
      ratification [see “Vote No AMPTP Ratification”], and endorsed a proposal to inform the Union's members by
      publishing our positions [See “For Immediate Release” “Indie musicians group condemns “Completely Unacceptable”
      AFM-AMPTP Terms on Generative AI”.]</p>

    <img class="img-fluid py-2" src="../assets/press-release.png">

    <p>IMC calls on all AFM members to join us in demanding a fair and democratic process on the AMPTP (and every other)
      Union negotiation and Ratification by <a
        href="mailto:imcafofm@gmail.com?subject=Please add my name to the open letter to AFM">signing our Open
        Letter</a>.<sup>*</sup></p>

    <p>We call on all AMPTP bargaining unit members who have not yet voted to send the Union back to the negotiating
      table by voting NO until we have real protections against displacement and exploitation via Generative AI.</p>

    <p>Few if any rank and file members have been permitted to see the actual contract terms, and of these some if not
      all have had to sign "non-disclosure agreements." The Union has refused our requests to share a timetable, and
      appears ready to keep the contract terms secret until the agreement is mailed out for a ratification vote. Such
      secrecy deprives members of the opportunity to study and discuss contract language that will impact the future of
      all recording members.</p>

    <p>We call on all who support an AFM which works for ALL its members to <a href="mailto:imcafofm@gmail.com">join
        with IMC</a> in fighting for the
      empowerment of Indie musicians within and through the AFM.<sup>*</sup></p>
