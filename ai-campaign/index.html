    <h1>Although AFM President Gagliardi has announced an agreement</h1>

    <p>with the AMPTP which “established critical guardrails against the misuse of AI,” we
      remain deeply concerned.</p>

    <p>Few if any rank and file members have been permitted to see the actual contract terms, and of these some if not
      all have had to sign "non-disclosure agreements." The Union has refused our requests to share a timetable, and
      appears ready to keep the contract terms secret until the agreement is mailed out for a ratification vote. Such
      secrecy deprives members of the opportunity to study and discuss contract language that will impact the future of
      all recording members.</p>

    <p>You can show your support for a democratic AFM by joining us in <a
        href="mailto:imcafofm@gmail.com?subject=Please add my name to the open letter to AFM">
        co-signing our Open Letter to the AFM</a>:</p>

        protections.</li>
      <li>Help us reach out to “bargaining unit”[*] voters.</li>

    Zoom and online formats, and publish conclusions on our Action Network page. You can participate in those
    discussions by signing the <a
