    <h1>We are “indie” musicians Union members</h1>

    <p>We record for indie or self released labels and work the
      recording-related network of clubs, festivals, and touring circuits.</p>

    <p> We are not marginal: According to the 2018 Indie Musicians Caucus of 802 Survey, over 18% of Local 802’s members
      earn the majority of their income
      from work in the indie sector. Over 70% of 802’s members do some work in the indie sector, as do the large
      majority of the NYC area’s 50-80 thousand unorganized music workers. We are not scabs or amateurs. We are
      working professional musicians: and we need a Union.</p>

    <p>But for nearly half a century, structural obstacles
      in the bylaws and institutional practices of the AFM and its locals have blocked indie musicians from
      recognizing the AFM as the Union we need. Indie musicians have little or no representation in Local 802’s
      government.</p>

    <p>There is no accountability of the Union’s governance to our community. Our rights to democratically control
      Union organizing of our gigs have not been respected by the Union. Local 802 has never committed the
      resources needed to organize our work: Adam Krauthamer’s Musicians for Change administration reduced the
      organizing department staff from the Members’ Party’s already inadequate three to its current number: zero.</p>

    <p>Indie musicians need a Union that represents, respects, and empowers us. In order to make the AFM that
      Union, we propose the following changes at the local 802 and AFM level:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Permit DJ/Producers as AFM members</h4>
        <p>It is not possible to organize the contemporary recording industry—indie or major label—without representing
          the DJ/producers who create hip-hop, techno, EDM, etc.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>Repeal Article 10 Section 7 requiring the “Alligator Clause” in all AFM contracts.</h4>
        <p>AFM’s bylaws require
          that all contracts—even for live gigs—must include an “alligator” clause specifying that any recording
          taking place under the contract is subject to AFM requirements. It is forbidden to include any recording
          language other than that. Precisely which AFM contract is appropriate in any situation is determined by the
          AFM. While we agree that no contracts should undercut AFM recording scale, this clause violates indie
          musicians’ democratic right to determine our own demands. And it gives AFM “International” Union officers
          who are not elected by or accountable to local indie members decision making power (to effectively deny or
          permit all recording work) in every AFM contract. It has effectively blocked indie organizing of local live
          performance--few indie musicians are going to give an unaccountable International AFM control of whether
          they work or not—without significantly increasing the amount of recorded work under Union contract.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>Voice in governance</h4>
        <p> Union Executive Boards should recognize Indie Musician Caucuses at the Local
          level, and give them voice in all decisions affecting Indie musicians.The AFM should establish an Indie
          Musicians’ Members Conference with a vote on the International Executive Board, and voice in all AFM
          contract approval processes affecting Indie musicians.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>A Tiered Dues option for active organizing campaigns</h4>
        <p>For musicians working intermittent gigs, no single one of which pays enough to justify full Union new member
          dues, the demand for full dues is an impediment to organizing. We propose that Local Executive Boards be
          permitted, at the request of organizers and rank and file organizing committees from the bargaining units
          affected, to establish tiered levels of membership dues for new members inducted through active indie sector
          organizing campaigns, with the amount of dues pegged, for a limited time, to the amounts earned through work
          under Union contract. If enacted as one component of an overall campaign that also includes concrete
          strategies and benchmarks for bringing additional venues under contract, and developed in dialogue with
          organizers and indie musicians from the gig (the “bargaining unit”), a tiered system of dues/membership
          could help grow the union in the indie sector.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>Honesty</h4>
        <p>Repeal bylaw provisions pledging members to accept only Union work. The right to fine members for non-union
          work should be restricted to the actual current practice: fining members who violate “do not work” orders
          during an active organizing campaign or collective action, or limited to musicians accepting non-union work
          in normally unionized sectors of the field (i.e. scabs).Indie musicians work in an unorganized sector of
          the industry. The majority of our work is non-union due to factors beyond our control. Forcing us to choose
          between Union membership and our life’s work has not helped us organize and will never grow the
          Union.According to the 2018 Local 802 Indie Musicians Caucus survey, fewer than 5% of Local 802’s members
          earn their living exclusively from work under Union contract.Being forced to lie as a condition of Union
          membership is unacceptable.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>Hire the organizers needed to carry out an organizing campaign in the indie sector</h4>
        <p>Local 802 currently has no organizing department. Organizing our sector is impossible if local 802 lacks the
          staff to carry it out.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>End all barriers to indie participation in Union governance</h4>
        <p>Local 802: Article 1 sections 8, 9, & 10, denies the right of bandleaders to serve as union officers “They
          shall not be permitted to accept any engagements as Leader (Personnel Manager) to furnish bands, orchestras
          or musicians for any labor organization or make any recommendations for such musicians.”</p>
        <p>Various locals have rules preventing officers from taking non-union work.</p>
        <p>Other bylaws give officers of the AFM the right to deny seating to Convention delegates on the basis of
          “Leader” status.</p>
        <p>Given that the overwhelming majority of indie musicians work as a leader at some point (on
          live and/or recorded projects), these bylaws effectively prevent indie musicians from participating in
          Union Government.</p>
        <p>Such restrictive bylaws may be selectively enforced to disempower and disenfranchise indie members.</p>
        <p>All such barriers must be removed by national mandate at all levels of the Union or modified by language
          restricting them to members who regularly serve as employers of musicians working under Union contract, or
          accepting non-union work in normally unionized sectors of the economy.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>End the ability of Union Officers to violate members rights with impunity</h4>
        <p>Many hired union officials are
          also members. These are granted virtual impunity by the following article of the IEB Policy Book:</p>
         
        <blockquote class="blockquote fst-italic">
          <p>&ldquo;The board has determined that it would be inappropriate to apply that procedure
            [bringing charges against a
            Union official: Article 13/Article 11: 2007 Bylaws] in special circumstances where the charged party is both
            an employee of the Federation (e.g. a staff representative) and an AFM member, and, in addition, the alleged
            misconduct that is the subject of the charge relates solely to the manner in which the charged party carried
            out the duties he or she was assigned by the Federation as his or her employer.&rdquo;</p>
        </blockquote>
         
        <p>This rule means that any higher official of the AFM can break contracts or violate the bylaws with impunity
          so long as they mask their own decision-making role behind an employee/member, who later, when charged with
          the violation, pleads “I was only following orders.” Such “bending” of the rules benefits well connected
          elites at the expense of indie musicians. This and other anti-democratic clauses ought to be deleted from
          the IEB Policy Book as well as the National and Local
          bylaws.</p>
    </ul>

    <p>The proposals above were drafted by the Indie Musicians Caucus of the AFM. (IMC-AFM), a non-recognized caucus
      of, by, and for Indie AFM members. We urge all Indie AFM members to join with us in working towards the
      empowerment of Indie musicians within and through the Union. IMC-AFM will be making endorsements in Local
      Union elections. We urge all candidates for Union office willing to endorse the above IMC-AFM proposals to
